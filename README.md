# Weather App - Neng Lao
# Overview
This Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for their favorite cities. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and provides a user-friendly interface for displaying weather information. The original figma design was created by Johnny Pham and the goal of the project is to be able to build other people's design.

# Features
- Front-end Design: The application has a clean and intuitive user interface designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.
- Local Storage: Users can save their favorite cities, and the application stores them locally using the browser's local storage feature. This allows users to quickly access weather information for their preferred locations without the need for repeated searches.
- OpenWeather API Integration: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API, including current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and forecast for the next few days.
- Dynamic Weather Status Updates: A function dynamically updates the weather status image based on the weather condition retrieved from the API response. This provides users with visual representations of the weather conditions.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information for any city worldwide. Upon entering a city name and clicking the search button, the application retrieves and displays the relevant weather data.
